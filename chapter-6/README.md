This Project introduces us to 
 - intermediate aggregator pipeline ✅
 - understanding document references 
 - Populating reference documents
 - using common aggregation operators

MVC stands for Model–View–Controller.
It is a software architecture pattern used to structure applications in a clean, organized, and scalable way.

Client Request → Router → Controller → Model → Controller → View/Response

The aggregation pipeline is like a series of transformations on your documents. $match filters, $group aggregates, $project reshapes, $sort orders, $lookup joins, $unwind flattens arrays… and you can chain many stages together to get almost any complex query result.
